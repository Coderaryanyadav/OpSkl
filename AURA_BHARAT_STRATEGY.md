**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Role:** Combined Principal PM, Apple Interface Strategist, YC Partner  
**Status:** DRAFT FOR APPROVAL

## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## PHASE 0 — PRODUCT TRUTH (NO ASSUMPTIONS)
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*   **What the product CLAIMS to be:** A "tactical operative network" for global freelance missions.
*   **What it ACTUALLY is:** A high-end, localized gig marketplace for the Indian professional middle-class, focusing on **Trust-as-a-Service**.
*   **The IDEAL User:** A verified Indian professional (Designer, Technician, Coordinator) who values payment security over anonymous bidding.
*   **Who this is NOT for:** Casual hobbyists or international clients seeking "cheap" unverified labor.
*   **The CORE Job-to-be-Done:** *"Ensure I get paid 100% of my agreed fee, instantly and via UPI, without the client dragging me off-platform to avoid fees."*

**Vision Critique:** The "Cyberpunk/Operative" branding is a "Developer Fetish" that adds cognitive load for a professional Indian audience. The pivot to **Aura Bharat**—using professional, tactical language—is essential for trust and mass-market scaling.

## PHASE 1 — USER PSYCHOLOGY & PAIN MAPPING
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*   **First-Use State:** "Hopeful but skeptical." If the app looks cheap, they assume the escrow is fake.
*   **Frustration Point:** Terminologies like "Broadcast" or "Operative" creating doubt about the app's legality/professionalism.
*   **Churn Moment:** When a user is asked to apply for a gig but cannot see if the money is actually deposited in the platform escrow.
*   **Trust Opportunity:** Change "Status: Pending" to **"SIGNAL: ESCROW SECURED (Verified by Bharat Trust Protocol)"**.

## PHASE 2 — THE MOAT: FEATURE ROADMAP
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 1️⃣ TABLE-STAKES (Launch Blockers)
*   **Verified UPI Persistence:** No more mock data. Real-time linking of UPI handles to the user profile.
*   **Aadhaar-KYC Badge:** Integration with DigiLocker API (or mocked with real verification data logic) to provide "Blue Check" credibility.
*   **Phone Number Primary Auth:** Removing email/password for the 10-digit mobile + OTP standard.

### 2️⃣ TRUST & SAFETY (The "Unfair Advantage")
*   **Spotlight Escrow (Visual Wallet):** A persistent UI header when a "Kaam" is active that shows exactly where the money is sitting (Platform Bank).
*   **NLP Signal Watchdog:** A chat-layer AI that flags and prevents "Leakage" (sharing WhatsApp numbers or bank details to bypass the commission).

### 3️⃣ RETENTION & HABIT-FORMING
*   **Price Pulse:** Real-time city-level market rate analysis for gig categories (e.g., "What is a 2-hour shoot paying in Mumbai today?").
*   **Streak-Based Commission:** Lower the platform fee from 15% to 8% for professionals with a 99% on-time delivery streak.

### 4️⃣ DIFFERENTIATION (The Moat)
*   **Haptic Handshake:** A synchronized haptic feedback event where both parties must be within 10m (proximity) to release the final 10% of funds for physical jobs.

## PHASE 3 — STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1.  **LAUNCH BLOCKERS:** Phone OTP, Persistent UPI, Aadhaar Verification UI. (Must be real, no gimmicks).
2.  **RETENTION DRIVERS:** Price Pulse, Proximity-Based Feed.
3.  **REVENUE MULTIPLIERS:** Priority Kaam Boosting, NLP Leakage Shield.
4.  **LONG-TERM MOAT:** Synchronized Haptic Handshake for Proof-of-Delivery.

## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## PHASE 4 — MVP vs SCALE vs ENTERPRISE
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*   **MVP (Bharat 1.0):** Clean UI, Phone Login, UPI Wallet, Escrow Visibility, Terminology Fix.
*   **Growth (Scale):** Price Pulse AI, Signal Share (Viral Growth), Regional Language Support (Hindi/Kannada/Tamil).
*   **Enterprise:** GST Invoicing, Bulk Team Management for Agencies.

## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## PHASE 5 — MARKET LEAPFROG
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*   **vs. Fiverr/Upwork:** They are global and slow. Aura is **Local and Real-time**.
*   **vs. Local Classifieds:** They are scam-ridden. Aura is **Escrow-Hardened**.
*   **Opportunity:** Every "Leaky" transaction on WhatsApp is a customer we can steal by offering a **₹10,000 Insurance Guarantee** on every verified Kaam.

5.  **Gamified "Levels" with no monetary value** (Professionals find this childish).

**PROPOSED FIRST CODING SPRINT:**
1.  Update `Profile` schema to support `upi_id` and `aadhaar_status`.
2.  Hard-code terminology change (Mission -> Kaam) in all remaining screens.
3.  Implement the **Escrow Trust Shield** in `GigDetailsScreen`.

**DO YOU APPROVE THIS STRATEGY?**  
*(Reply with "Approve" or specific edits to continue implementation.)*
